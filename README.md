# DirectUpload

Direct Upload creates a convenient way to upload and get urls for S3 buckets.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "direct_upload", :git => "git://github.com/cameronbarker/direct_upload.git"
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install direct_upload -l git://github.com/cameronbarker/direct_upload.git
```

## Configuration

```ruby
DirectUpload.configure do |config|
  config.aws_access_key_id = 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
  config.aws_secret_access_key = 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
  config.aws_bucket_name = 'AWS_BUCKET_NAME'
  config.aws_region = 'AWS_REGION'
end
```

## Usage

You can either upload a file or csv directly up to S3. The methods will return the string of a AWS S3 Url.

**File**

```ruby
DirectUpload.file("path/to/file", "filename.txt", s3_options = {})
DirectUpload.file(FileObject, "filename.txt", s3_options = {})
```

**CSV**

```ruby
csv_arr = [[arr, of, arrs], [arr, of, arrs]]
DirectUpload.csv(csv_arr, "filename.csv", s3_options = {})
```

## S3 Options

The below options can be passed through to `DirectUpload.file` or `DirectUpload.csv`.

Direct Upload comes with default parameters of `expires: Time.now.utc + (60 * 60 * 24 * 1), acl: "public-read"`.

`:prefix_path` (String) - Path within S3 bucket the file should be saved to. i.e. "BUCKETNAME/prefix_path/filename"

`:grant_full_control` (String) - Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the

`:metadata` (Hash) - A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.  
`:server_side_encryption` (String) - The Server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3  
`:storage_class` (String) - The type of storage to use for the object. Defaults to \'STANDARD\'.  
`:website_redirect_location` (String) - If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this  
`:sse_customer_algorithm` (String) - Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (e.g.,  
`:sse_customer_key` (String) - Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in  
`:sse_customer_key_md5` (String) - Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC  
`:ssekms_key_id` (String) - Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and  
`:request_payer` (String) - Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

`:tagging` (String) - The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query  
`:use_accelerate_endpoint` (Boolean) - When true, the "https://BUCKETNAME.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com" endpoint will be used.
